# A2A Bridge Production Deployment Guide

This guide details the deployment architectures, configuration requirements, security invariants, and operational procedures for deploying the Scion A2A Bridge in high-availability (HA) multi-instance topologies across Google Cloud Run and Kubernetes.

---

## 1. Cloud Run Multi-Instance Deployment

### Architecture & Networking
- **Platform Ingress:** Terminated at Cloud Run's external HTTPS load balancer.
- **Container Listener:** Single port cleartext `h2c` (`HTTP/2 cleartext`) via `PORT=8080` and `MUX_PORTS=true`.
- **Multiplexing:** The single `h2c` listener multiplexes incoming gRPC (`BrokerService`) from the Hub and JSON-RPC / SSE over HTTP from external Gemini Enterprise clients.
- **Minimum Scaling:** Set `autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale: "2"` to guarantee active multi-replica presence for immediate lease handover and failover resilience.

### Dual-Header Authentication Semantics
Cloud Run enforces a two-tier identity boundary:
1. `X-Serverless-Authorization: Bearer <ID_TOKEN>`: Evaluated and consumed by Cloud Run's platform ingress for `roles/run.invoker` IAM checks. Cloud Run strips this header before dispatching the request to the container.
2. `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>`: Passes through directly to the container application:
   - For gRPC control RPCs: Evaluated by the bridge's `UnaryAuthInterceptor` against `GRPC_AUTH_SUBJECTS`.
   - For client JSON-RPC requests: Evaluated by the bridge's A2A bearer token middleware.

### Principal Separation Invariant
- **Hub Service Account (`hub-sa@...`):** Authorized in `GRPC_AUTH_SUBJECTS` to invoke control methods (`Configure`, `Publish`, `Subscribe`, `Unsubscribe`, `HealthCheck`, `GetInfo`).
- **GE Discovery Engine Invoker (`ge-invoker@...`):** Granted Cloud Run `roles/run.invoker` to reach the HTTPS endpoint, but strictly NOT listed in `GRPC_AUTH_SUBJECTS`. Attempting to invoke gRPC control RPCs with the GE invoker identity is rejected with `codes.PermissionDenied`.
- **Required IAM restriction:** The example uses `run.googleapis.com/ingress: all`, so the service is reachable at the network layer. Grant `roles/run.invoker` only to the expected Hub and GE invoker service accounts, keep those principals distinct, and never grant it to `allUsers` or `allAuthenticatedUsers`. Cloud Run IAM is the platform boundary; the bridge's JWT validation must remain enabled as application-level defense in depth.

### Substitute an Immutable Image Digest
Both example manifests intentionally contain an all-zero `sha256` placeholder that cannot be deployed. Before applying either manifest:

1. Build and push the bridge image under a release tag.
2. Resolve the registry-reported digest, for example with `gcloud artifacts docker images describe IMAGE_URI:TAG --format='value(image_summary.digest)'`.
3. Replace the entire `gcr.io/scion-prod/scion-a2a-bridge@sha256:000...000` value in the target manifest with `IMAGE_URI@sha256:<64-hex-digest>`. Do not replace it with `:latest` or another mutable tag.
4. Run `go test ./integration -run 'Test(CloudRun|Kubernetes)ManifestValidation' -count=1` from `extras/scion-a2a-bridge`, then apply the manifest through the normal reviewed deployment process.

### Shared Storage
All instances connect to a central PostgreSQL 15 database instance (e.g. Cloud SQL with Cloud SQL Auth Proxy sidecar or private IP VPC connector). Leases and state are managed via `a2a_sdk_tasks`.

### Health, Rollback, and Cleanup
- **Probes:** Configured via `startupProbe` and `livenessProbe` querying `GET /healthz` on port 8080.
- **Rollback:**
  ```bash
  gcloud run services update-traffic scion-a2a-bridge \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --to-revisions=PREV_REVISION=100
  ```
- **Cleanup:**
  ```bash
  gcloud run services delete scion-a2a-bridge --region=us-central1 --quiet
  ```

## 2. Kubernetes Multi-Replica Deployment

### Architecture & Service Definition
- **Deployment:** Defined with `replicas: 2` (or greater) using `RollingUpdate` strategy (`maxSurge: 1`, `maxUnavailable: 0`).
- **Service:** Headless or ClusterIP Service exposing port 8080 with `appProtocol: kubernetes.io/h2c`.
- **Ingress:** Ingress controller (GKE Ingress, NGINX, or Istio) terminating TLS and routing to Service.
- **TLS Example:** The manifest maps `bridge.example.com` to TLS secret `scion-a2a-bridge-tls`; replace both the rule/TLS host and secret name with provisioned values before applying it.

### Credentials & Identity
- **PostgreSQL Connection:** Secret `a2a-postgres-secret` containing `database-url`.
- **Identity Options:**
  - Google ID Token validation via GKE Workload Identity.
  - Native mTLS with certificates mounted from secrets (`GRPC_TLS_CERT`, `GRPC_TLS_KEY`, `GRPC_TLS_CLIENT_CA`) when running dedicated gRPC listeners.
- **GE invoker boundary:** Keep the GE invoker principal distinct from every Hub control principal. Configure an identity-aware Ingress/Gateway, service-mesh authorization policy, or equivalent control to admit that GE principal; use Workload Identity where an in-cluster workload identity participates in the path. The example manifest contains only the routing/TLS shape and a prerequisite comment—it does not install or claim live enforcement of a provider-specific authorization policy. Application-level bearer/JWT validation remains required.

### Health, Rollback, and Cleanup
- **Probes:** `readinessProbe` and `livenessProbe` checking HTTP `/healthz`.
- **Rollback:**
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout undo deployment/scion-a2a-bridge -n scion
  kubectl rollout status deployment/scion-a2a-bridge -n scion
  ```
- **Cleanup:**
  ```bash
  kubectl delete -f deploy/kubernetes/deployment.yaml -n scion
  ```

## 3. Hub Exchange & OAuth Client Configuration

When configuring Google credential exchange in `pkg/hub`:

### Client IDs & Redirect URIs
- `allowed_client_ids`: Explicit allowlist of OAuth 2.0 Web / Desktop Client IDs issued by Google Cloud Console. Wildcards or empty values fail closed at startup.
- `redirect_uris`: Approved redirect URIs configured on Google Cloud Console and matching Hub origin.

### Token Lifetime & No Refresh Tokens
- **Short-Lived Access/ID Tokens Only:** Hub Google exchange validates incoming Google credentials and issues scoped, short-lived Hub JWTs (default 1h, max 24h).
- **NO Refresh Tokens:** The A2A Bridge and Hub exchange deliberately DO NOT support, store, or issue OAuth refresh tokens. Clients must rotate short-lived credentials upstream through Google STS / OAuth rather than caching persistent refresh tokens in bridge storage.

## 4. Verification Boundary: Dry-Run vs. Live Deployment

| Target | Local Deterministic / Dry-Run | External Live Validation |
|--------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Cloud Run Manifest | PASS (`TestCloudRunManifestValidation`) | `false` (Requires live Cloud Run deployment) |
| Kubernetes Manifest | PASS (`TestKubernetesManifestValidation`) | `false` (Requires live GKE cluster) |
| PostgreSQL Multi-Process | PASS (`go test ./integration`) | `true` (Runs against real PostgreSQL 15) |
| Google Token Exchange | PASS (Deterministic fake Google JWKS) | `false` (Requires live Google STS / GE environment) |

Live qualification runs must record output according to `docs/evidence-template.md`.
