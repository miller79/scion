// Package config: legacy "grove" -> "project" migration.
//
// This file holds the legacy grove->project migration support: the Reporter
// contract that the CLI, hub, and broker each render in their own idiom, and
// the warning for legacy environment variables that are no longer read. It
// is meant to be the only non-test file that still knows legacy "grove"
// names once the rest of the rename lands: the legacy names become
// unexported constants here, and every reader/writer in the rest of the tree
// goes through the canonical "project" names only.
//
// On-disk layout migration is expected to reuse the same Reporter and hook
// points (see ptone/scion#1919).
