# Final Deterministic Integration Harness (#1620)

**Date:** 2026-09-18
**Branch:** `scion/dev-postmerge-integration-harness-final-fixes`
**Issue:** #1620
**Merge base:** `0c07fdee3eefac5a21f93878211bf507b2e5c6a7` (current merged `main`, including PR #1746)

## Summary

Ported the complete, deterministic, real-process integration test harness for Gemini Enterprise A2A (#1620) onto merged `main`. The integration harness executes against real subprocess topologies (Hub, Bridge replicas, Alternator proxy, Fake Google JWKS) with real loopback networking, authenticated gRPC transport, and real PostgreSQL database instances.

Zero production Go code was modified, preserving the post-merge tree integrity. All 20 local deterministic test cases pass cleanly under the retained single-run, `-race`, and `-count=3` evidence. A dedicated fail-closed CI entry and runner script provision PostgreSQL 15 and fail closed if the database is missing. Example deployment manifests for Cloud Run and Kubernetes are verified via deterministic dry-run parsing tests. External live deployment and external Gemini Enterprise envelope capture remain marked `external-live-only` / `passing: false` in `testdata/acceptance_layers.json`.

## Scope & Boundaries Followed

1. **Zero production Go changes:** No changes to `pkg/`, `cmd/`, or `extras/scion-a2a-bridge/internal/`. No `Milliseconds()` addition to `pgstore.go`.
2. **Resolved diagnostic mock dedup (#1746):** Upstream PR #1746 merged the duplicate mock resolution on `extras/scion-a2a-bridge/internal/bridge/followup_test.go:166` into `main` at `0c07fdee3eefac5a21f93878211bf507b2e5c6a7`. Current `main` is merged cleanly into this branch with zero conflicts, allowing the full bridge package suite (`go test ./...`) to pass cleanly end-to-end.
3. **Deterministic lease and crash synchronization:** Replaced the legacy sleep in `TestCrashLeaseBoundary` with bounded active PostgreSQL polling on `exec_heartbeat < NOW() - interval '2 seconds'`. Replaced the post-terminal sleep with deterministic observable synchronization (`/__test/janitor-cycle`) across both replicas, with causal regression assertions verifying `reapedCount == 0` and zero Hub message replay before manual retry. `/__test/janitor-cycle` executes a deterministic maintenance pass (`ReapStaleTasks` then `RunSweep`). Scoped no-replay evidence is verified as terminal fencing plus post-terminal maintenance pass and unchanged Hub counter (not a global poll/executor callback barrier). Crash behavior is precisely verified as durable stale-task failure/reap plus visible terminal event and no automatic Hub replay (no successful execution reclaim is claimed).
4. **Exact cursor/reconnect verification:** Proved intermediate event absence from snapshot history, verified `a2a_task_events.id > a2a_sdk_tasks.last_event_cursor`, single stream delivery, absence of duplicate replay, and verified `_bridgeEventID` never leaks.
5. **gRPC BrokerService 6 Unary Methods:** `controlRPCErrors` explicitly verifies the six unary methods of `proto/broker/v1` `BrokerService`: `Configure`, `Publish`, `Subscribe`, `Unsubscribe`, `HealthCheck`, and `GetInfo`.
6. **Process & resource hygiene:** Kernel-allocated dynamic ports (`127.0.0.1:0`), process tree termination and wait reaping on test completion, per-test PostgreSQL schema isolation (`harness_run_*`), and verification of undisturbed canary data in `test_canary.sentinel`.
7. **CI fail-closed execution & runner verification:** Integration harness requires PostgreSQL 15 and `psql` when running under `CI=true` or `TEST_REQUIRE_DATABASE=1`, failing closed (`t.Fatal` / exit code 1) rather than silently skipping. Runner redacts all DSN credentials (`Using TEST_DATABASE_URL=[REDACTED]`), requires `psql`, validates exact pre- and post-test canary sentinel identity and value (`canary-1` -> `must-survive`) without modifying unrelated rows, and parses `go test -json` machine-readable output across all test phases (normal, race, repetition count=3) to fail closed on any `Action=skip`. Deliberate negative runner tests verified: absent DB (exit 1), missing psql (exit 1), injected test skip via `TestInjectedSkipFixture` (exit 1), and canary row mutation (exit 1).
8. **Deployment manifests and dry-run validation:** Cloud Run multi-instance (`deploy/cloudrun/service.yaml`) and Kubernetes multi-replica (`deploy/kubernetes/deployment.yaml`) manifests are deterministically validated via `TestCloudRunManifestValidation` and `TestKubernetesManifestValidation`. Documentation covers dual headers (`X-Serverless-Authorization` vs `Authorization`), principal separation (`hub-sa` vs `ge-invoker`), health/rollback/cleanup, and strict no-refresh-token OAuth exchange.
9. **Matrix & documentation reflection:** `testdata/acceptance_layers.json` and docs reflect actual local deterministic proof. Live external Gemini Enterprise capture, Cloud Run live deployment, and Kubernetes live deployment remain marked `external-live-only` / `passing: false`.
10. **Test-only dependency closure:** The `go.mod`/`go.sum` additions in `extras/scion-a2a-bridge/` are strictly limited to the exact transitive dependency closure required by the test-only modernc SQLite driver (`modernc.org/sqlite`, `modernc.org/libc`, `modernc.org/mathutil`, `modernc.org/memory`, `github.com/dustin/go-humanize`, `github.com/ncruces/go-strftime`, `github.com/remyoudompheng/bigfft`). These are needed solely by `serveHubProcess` to back the Hub ent adapter with a temporary SQLite database (`SCION_TEST_HUB_DATABASE`) without external dependencies. Zero production code references these drivers.

## Acceptance Layers & Scope

| Layer | Focus Area | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Layer 1** | Auth, Cache, Transport | LOCAL PASS (Parent partial) | `TestColdReplicaAndRotation`, `TestControlPlanePrincipalIsolation`, `TestCredentialRedaction` (per-replica exchange counts, token rotation, Hub restart over durable SQLite identity, 6 unary gRPC principal isolations: Configure, Publish, Subscribe, Unsubscribe, HealthCheck, GetInfo). `actual-ge-capture` remains `external-live-only` / `passing: false`. |
| **Layer 2** | HA Lifecycle | PASS | `TestTwoReplicaUserLifecycle` (input-required boundary, continuation across replicas, cancellation with waiter termination, no post-cancel replay, caller/project/agent authorization boundaries). |
| **Layer 3** | Cursor & Reconnect | PASS | `TestCrossReplicaStreamCursor` (intermediate event absent from snapshot payload/history, DB `event_id > last_event_cursor`, streams exactly once, no old replay via `assertNoSSE`, internal `_bridgeEventID` stripped). |
| **Layer 4** | Crash & Lease Boundary | PASS | `TestCrashLeaseBoundary` (observable DB heartbeat lease expiration query without fixed sleep, replica crash/restart, terminal fencing plus post-terminal maintenance pass via `/__test/janitor-cycle`, reapedCount==0, unchanged Hub message counter before manual retry, durable stale-task failure/reap plus visible terminal event and no automatic Hub replay). |
| **Layer 5** | Process & Resource Hygiene | PASS | `TestProcessTopologyStartsDistinctProcessesAndCancelsThem`, `TestLoadAlternatorUsesRealProcessesAndPinsSSE`, `TestDatabaseRunNamingAndCleanup`, `TestPostgreSQLSchemaAllocator` (dynamic ports, process reaping, schema isolation, canary survival). |
| **Layer 6** | Matrix & Docs Reflection | PASS | `TestAcceptanceLayersMatchProvenScope`, `TestFixtureMatricesContainApprovedCategories`, `testdata/acceptance_layers.json` (reflects real evidence; external GE live capture remains false). |
| **Layer 7** | Cloud Run Deployment Config | LOCAL PASS (Parent partial) | `TestCloudRunManifestValidation`, `deploy/cloudrun/service.yaml`, `docs/deployment.md` (`minScale: 2`, `h2c` port 8080, dual headers, `hub-sa` vs `ge-invoker` isolation, health/rollback/cleanup). External live deployment remains `external-live-only` / `passing: false`. |
| **Layer 8** | Kubernetes Deployment Config | LOCAL PASS (Parent partial) | `TestKubernetesManifestValidation`, `deploy/kubernetes/deployment.yaml`, `docs/deployment.md` (2+ replicas, RollingUpdate, `a2a-postgres-secret`, Service with `kubernetes.io/h2c`, Ingress, health/rollback/cleanup). External live deployment remains `external-live-only` / `passing: false`. |
| **Layer 9** | CI Automated Integration | PASS | `CIAutomatedPostgresIntegration`, `make test-a2a-integration`, `extras/scion-a2a-bridge/scripts/run-integration-ci.sh`, `.github/workflows/extras-ci.yml` (provisions PostgreSQL 15, sets `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, fails closed if DB missing). The workflow is configured and locally validated; no remote GitHub Actions execution is claimed. |

## Final Gate Finding Resolution

| Finding | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Cloud Run `ingress: all` prerequisite | Resolved in the adjacent manifest comment and deployment guide: restrict `roles/run.invoker` to the distinct Hub and GE service accounts; never grant public principals; retain application JWT validation. |
| Mutable example images | Resolved: both manifests use explicit all-zero, nondeployable `@sha256:<64 hex>` placeholders, with substitution steps. Manifest tests reject `:latest` and require digest-form references. |
| Kubernetes TLS and GE principal | Resolved: the Ingress example has a TLS host/secret, tests assert host routing and TLS-host agreement, and comments/docs assign GE-principal enforcement to an identity-aware Ingress/Gateway, service-mesh policy, Workload Identity, or equivalent without claiming live enforcement. |
| Cloud Run GE/Hub separation | Resolved: manifest validation requires a nonempty `GE_INVOKER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` distinct from every comma-separated `GRPC_AUTH_SUBJECTS` principal. Dual-header wire proof remains attributed to transport integration tests and documentation, not YAML parsing. |
| Project-log history/path accuracy | Resolved: runner path is `extras/scion-a2a-bridge/scripts/run-integration-ci.sh`; merge-base/current-main narrative is `0c07fdee`, with the existing merge DAG preserved exactly. |
| Durable report accuracy | Resolved in `/scion-volumes/scratchpad/projects/ge-a2a/dev-postmerge-integration-harness-report.md` after the correction commit and durability push, including the exact successor SHA and current-main diff count. |
| Security Info findings | Dispositioned with no runtime changes: the `http.DefaultTransport` mutation occurs only in an isolated test helper subprocess, so process isolation is the correctness boundary; ephemeral CI-only `scion/scion` PostgreSQL credentials are not reusable secrets; Kubernetes GE-principal documentation is resolved above. |

## Final Bounded Verification

- RED proof before manifest edits: `go test ./integration -run 'Test(CloudRun|Kubernetes)ManifestValidation' -count=1` failed on both `:latest` image references.
- Focused normal/YAML parse: the same command passed (`ok`, 0.138s); both YAML files were unmarshaled with `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` and all structural assertions passed.
- Focused race: `go test -race ./integration -run 'Test(CloudRun|Kubernetes)ManifestValidation' -count=1` passed (`ok`, 1.452s).
- One normal real-PostgreSQL run: `TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgres://scion:scion@127.0.0.1:5432/a2a_test?sslmode=disable' TEST_REQUIRE_DATABASE=1 go test -v ./integration -count=1` passed all 20 tests (`ok`, 13.753s). The local PostgreSQL 15 process was stopped afterward.
- `make fmt-check`, `make compat-literals`, `git diff --check 0c07fdee...HEAD`, and `git diff --check` all exited 0.
- `git diff --name-only e9b34d2a...` confirms the correction changes only manifests, their focused validation test, deployment documentation, and this project log; runtime topology tests and production Go remain untouched.

## PR #1748 Review-Fix Final Delivery

**Date:** 2026-09-19
**Temporary branch:** `scion/dev-postmerge-integration-harness-review-fixes-resume`
**Preserved WIP ancestor:** `c7dec1a4f139d283e1a209bebf3f73fda1e13d51`
**Exact accepted PR head/base:** `29e8a45ccd11b4db77ea1fee04945917a129af94`

The bounded review correction is complete. No production code and no separately owned
PR #1747 fix was imported or duplicated.

### Upstream Review Findings

- `storePre` has a deferred fallback close before either query can fail, while its
  successful-path close remains at the original pre-stream point.
- Both intentionally disconnected SSE response bodies have deferred fallback closure
  before assertions can fail, while their successful paths still close immediately at
  the intended disconnect boundaries.
- `run-integration-ci.sh` creates one invocation-owned directory with
  `mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/scion-a2a-integration.XXXXXX"`; every JSON log is created
  beneath that directory, and cleanup removes only that exact directory. There is no
  broad `/tmp` glob.
- The `EXIT` cleanup runs on normal completion and early failure. HUP, INT, and TERM
  traps convert each signal to the corresponding exit status, which then reaches the
  same exact-path `EXIT` cleanup. Focused regressions prove normal/failure cleanup,
  signal interruption, concurrent invocation isolation, unrelated-file preservation,
  skip rejection, canary mutation detection, and credential redaction.
- Generic `CI=true` no longer implies that PostgreSQL was provisioned: the four
  PostgreSQL-dependent integration tests may skip when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is absent.
  `TEST_REQUIRE_DATABASE=1` remains fail-closed, and the actual dedicated runner sets it,
  rejects every `Action=skip`, and runs the complete integration package.

### Final Verification

- `go test ./integration -run 'TestIntegrationRunner' -count=1`: PASS (`0.404s`).
- `go test -race ./integration -run 'TestIntegrationRunner' -count=1`: PASS (`1.721s`).
- Generic no-PostgreSQL workflow equivalent with `CI=true`: PASS with exactly four
  skips, one for each selected PostgreSQL-dependent test.
- Fresh PostgreSQL 15.19 execution through the actual `scripts/run-integration-ci.sh`
  with `TEST_REQUIRE_DATABASE=1`: standard PASS (`14.315s`), race PASS (`30.127s`),
  count=3 PASS (`42.049s`), zero skips and zero failures in every phase. The run included
  `TestColdReplicaAndRotation`, exercising the SQLite-backed durable Hub identity path.
  Output showed `Using TEST_DATABASE_URL=[REDACTED]` only, and both the runner and an
  independent final query confirmed exactly `canary-1=must-survive`.
- ShellCheck 0.11.0 on `scripts/run-integration-ci.sh`: PASS.
- `make fmt-check`, `make compat-literals`, root `go vet ./...`, root
  `go build -buildvcs=false ./...`, bridge `go vet ./integration`, and bridge
  `go build -buildvcs=false ./...`: PASS.
- Final staged/unstaged whitespace and scope checks are recorded in the durable delivery
  report alongside the immutable delivery commit and verified remote ref.
- Per the resume brief, the long root candidate/main `make test-fast` was not repeated;
  its earlier interrupted runs still carry no verdict.

### Actual PR #1748 CI Classification

- PR #1748 remains open at exact head `29e8a45ccd11b4db77ea1fee04945917a129af94`.
- Generic extras bridge job `105790395454` is branch-owned and addressed: its four
  decisive failures were `TestTwoReplicaUserLifecycle`, `TestCrossReplicaStreamCursor`,
  `TestCrashLeaseBoundary`, and `TestPostgreSQLSchemaAllocator`, each caused by the former
  over-broad `CI=true` database requirement.
- Dedicated PostgreSQL job `105790361080` is SUCCESS. Its actual log shows a redacted DSN,
  all standard/race/count=3 phases completing with zero skips and failures, and exact
  `canary-1=must-survive` preservation.
- Root Build & Test job `105790361187` failed on PersistentStore SQLite driver setup,
  exchange-route permission classification, and other Hub/authz census findings. Those
  findings were owned by separate PR #1747, which has since merged upstream. Validation
  of its actual merge result against current upstream `main` remains manager-owned and is
  outside this test/runner-only scope.

## Post-Merge Integration Harness Test-Quality Follow-Up

**Date:** 2026-09-19
**Branch:** `scion/dev-postmerge-integration-harness-test-fixes`
**Immutable candidate:** `135b73579601c55c0febb270e9f1fa3a6fecbe63`

The two Required test-quality findings were resolved without changing the integration
runner, production code, CI policy, or the separately owned root fixes:

- `TestIntegrationRunnerCleansArtifactsOnSignal` no longer snapshots, diffs, or schedules
  deletion of global `/tmp/ci-test-json.*` paths. The runner still receives a test-owned
  `TMPDIR`; the regression creates one exact unrelated legacy-pattern file while the
  runner is active and proves that file and an unrelated directory both survive.
- Every runner command started by
  `TestIntegrationRunnerConcurrentInvocationsAreIsolated` now has its own process group
  and an immediately registered cleanup that terminates the group, waits for the runner,
  and verifies the group is gone. All waits are bounded. Both fake runners stop on an
  explicit release file only after the test observes both ready markers and both
  invocation-owned directories. Forced-timeout and pre-barrier-failure subtests verify
  that no task-owned runner group or directory survives and that unrelated directories
  remain intact.

### RED/GREEN Evidence

- Deterministic RED commit
  `a20cc7e896f63f7120952c64ea3ef8117562b885` preserved both failing assertions.
  The signal test created an unrelated `/tmp/ci-test-json.*` file after the runner entered
  its held phase; the former global-diff logic failed with
  `signal-interrupted runner leaked legacy logs` and scheduled that foreign path for
  deletion. The concurrency test failed before launching a child with
  `runner-1 is not configured with an isolated process group`.
- GREEN commit `1271a35c95f5968ff44ff3ea3b38baaad2862b41` replaced global
  observation with exact-path assertions and introduced owned process-group lifecycle,
  explicit release, bounded waits, timeout cleanup, and pre-barrier cleanup.
- `go test ./integration -run '^TestIntegrationRunner' -count=1`: PASS (`0.491s`).
- `go test -race ./integration -run '^TestIntegrationRunner' -count=1`: PASS (`1.799s`).
- `go test ./integration -run '^TestIntegrationRunner(CleansArtifactsOnSignal|ConcurrentInvocationsAreIsolated)$' -count=20`:
  PASS (`4.254s`).
- `go test ./integration -count=1`: PASS (`12.322s`) under the existing optional-database
  semantics; the package completed without requiring an unavailable database.
- `make fmt-check`, `make compat-literals`, bridge `go vet ./integration`, bridge
  `go build -buildvcs=false ./...`, root `go build -buildvcs=false ./...`, and final
  whitespace/scope checks: PASS.
- ShellCheck was not repeated because the shell runner is unchanged. A new real-PostgreSQL
  run was unavailable in this container (no PostgreSQL client/server, container runtime,
  or database URL); the exact successor delta is test/log-only, so the candidate's prior
  real-PostgreSQL runner evidence remains unaffected.

No readiness conclusion is made here. PR #1747 has merged separately, and the manager will
inspect current-upstream overlap and validate the actual merge result before any readiness
decision.

## PR #1748 PostgreSQL Cursor-Replay CI Investigation

**Date:** 2026-09-19
**Frozen PR head:** `fecf85b6bdf5ebe69648556b67b3e5837ec2921d`
**CI job:** `105811994668`

The dedicated PostgreSQL job passed its normal phase (`13.920s`) and race phase
(`26.929s`) with zero skips, then failed the exact command
`go test -count=3 ./integration`. The sole failure was
`TestCrossReplicaStreamCursor` at the second `assertNoSSE`, after the test had already
observed `TASK_STATE_COMPLETED`. The runner's JSON-output extraction truncated the
historical payload at its first escaped quote, leaving only `{\`; therefore the original
event body, SSE ID, and type cannot be recovered from that immutable job log.

An equivalent task-owned PostgreSQL 15.19 cluster produced no local failure:

- unmodified frozen head, cursor-only `-count=3`: 3/3 PASS;
- unmodified frozen head, cursor-only `-count=20`: 20/20 PASS;
- diagnostic head, adjacent HA lifecycle plus cursor test, `GOMAXPROCS=2 -count=30`:
  30/30 cursor cases PASS;
- diagnostic head, exact failing phase command: 3/3 cursor cases PASS and package PASS
  (`41.894s`);
- diagnostic head, cursor-only `GOMAXPROCS=4 -count=60`: 60/60 PASS (`87.292s`).

The diagnostic-only test change preserves every no-replay and privacy assertion while
capturing allowlisted SSE event type and UUID ID, receipt time, task UUID, payload shape
and SHA-256 (never raw content), snapshot cursor, durable event IDs/kinds, ownership-presence
booleans, and heartbeat on any future failure. A representative run showed an empty SSE
event type, generated SSE ID, snapshot cursor `0`, durable `cursor-working` event after
that cursor, and one corresponding
`TASK_STATE_WORKING` SSE with no `_bridgeEventID` exposure.

Durable inspection showed no duplicate `(task_id, dedup_key)` groups and the expected
three-row final sequence per cursor task: `cursor-working` status, `cursor-final` artifact,
then `cursor-final:message`. The completed SDK snapshot advances through the artifact row;
the message row remains a legitimate later event and is the event that the durable
subscription maps to `TASK_STATE_COMPLETED`. Many completed snapshots therefore
legitimately have an event after `last_event_cursor`; a post-terminal negative time window
is not, by itself, a cursor-equality boundary.

Classification: **INCONCLUSIVE**. Local runs did not exhibit stale/foreign fixture
contamination, dedup failure, cross-task delivery, or owner/privacy leakage, but cannot
exclude those causes or a production cursor defect in CI. A distinct post-snapshot event,
a harness timing/negative-window assumption, and a real replay/duplicate are hypotheses,
not findings: the immutable CI truncation prevents identifying the extra frame. The
minimal next step is to retain safe diagnostic instrumentation and compare the allowlisted
frame ID/task/shape/hash against durable event IDs and snapshot cursor at a manager-authorized
future recurrence. No semantic test correction or production change is proposed.
No readiness conclusion is made here.
